    "**What is this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how hillsloeps change over time when processes like animals burrowing and freeze-thaw cycles slowly move sediment downhill. These processes can be modeled using the linear diffusion equation. In other words, the downhill flow of soil is proportional to the (downhill) gradient (slope) of the land surface multiplied by a transport coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook first illustrates a simple example of a hillslope modeled using the linear diffusion equation. We then provide a number of exercises for students to do on their own. This set of exercises is recomended for students in a quantitative geomorphology class, who have been introduced to the linear diffusion equation in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Application of linear diffusion transport law:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For relatively gentle, soil-mantled slopes, sediment transport can be approximated using the linear diffusion equation:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_s = -D \\nabla z\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where ${q}_s$ is the transport rate with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$;  $D$ is a transport coefficient with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$; and $z$ is elevation (dimensions L). $\\nabla z$ is the gradient in elevation. If distance is increasing downslope, $\\nabla z$ is negative downslope, hence the negative in front of $D$. \n",
    " \n",
    "The rate of change in elevation, i.e. erosion or deposition, is calculated from conservation of mass:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dt} = U-\\nabla q_s\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $U$ is the rock uplift rate, with dimensions LT$^{-1}$. We include a rock uplift term so that the hillslope can reach a steady state. Here steady state means that erosion is equal to the input of material from below (from rock uplift). At steady state, the elevation of the hillslope doesn't change. This model will also assume that all sediment flux at the bottom of the hillslope is removed, and the process responsible for removing sediment would likely be a river at the toe of the hillslope. This set-up and theoretical steady-state are useful for comparing model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this setup is equivalent to a steady erosion, likely from a river, at the toe of a hillslope. In this case there would be no rock uplift and the hillslope elevation would be going down steadily and uniformly once steady state is reached, but the form of the hillslope would not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everywhere in this notebook steady means not changing in time and uniform means not changing in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will we explore this with Landlab?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Landlab component *LinearDiffuser*, which implements the equations above, to explore how hillslopes change shape when linear diffusion is used to model hillslope sediment transport. We will explore both steady state and also how a landscape may transition to steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example illustrates how to set-up the model and evolve a hillslope to steady state, along with how to plot some variables of interest. We assume that you have knowledge of how to derive the steady-state form of a uniformly uplifting, diffusive hillslope. For more information on hillslope sediment transport laws, this paper is a great overview:\n",

    "Based on the first example, you are asked to think about what will happen as you change a parameter, and then you explore this numerically by changing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to run this notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (shift - enter OR got to the _Run_ pulldown menu at the top that has different options). \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can always go to the _Kernel_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Restart & Clear Output_ or _Restart & Run All_ if you change things and want to start afresh. If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated. (E.g. if you change parameters but don't first rerun the code blocks that initialize run time or topography, the changed parameters will apply on the existing hillslope.) "
