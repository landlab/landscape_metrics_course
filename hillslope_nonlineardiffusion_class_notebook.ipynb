    "**What is this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the evolution of landforms dominated by processes that result in nonlinear diffusion of sediment. In other words, the downhill flow of soil is nonlinearly proportional to the (downhill) gradient of the land surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook first illustrates a simple example of an evolving hillslope. We then provide a number of exercises for students to do on their own. This set of exercises is recomended for students in a quantitative geomorphology class, who have been introduced to a nonlinear diffusion equation in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Application of linear diffusion transport law:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In settings where slopes are steep and relatively rapid sediment transport occurs as slope steepen (think slope failure, landsliding), a transport law similar to the following may apply:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_s = -D \\bigg( 1 + \\Big( \\frac{S}{S_c} \\Big)^2 + \\Big( \\frac{S}{S_c} \\Big)^4 + ... + \\Big( \\frac{S}{S_c} \\Big)^{2(n-1)} \\bigg)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where ${q}_s$ is the transport rate with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$;  $D$ is a transport coefficient with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$; $S$ is slope ($-\\nabla z$, where $z$ is elevation, and it is assumed that distance is increasing downslope); $S_c$ is the critical slope; and $n$ is the number of terms. This equation is Ganti et al., (2012) https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011jf002181. (The default behavior of the Landlab component will be to use two terms in the equation above. That is what is explored in this notebook.)\n",
    " \n",
    "Changes in elevation, or erosion, are calculated from conservation of mass:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dt} = U-\\nabla q_s\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $U$ is the rock uplift rate, with dimensions LT$^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will we explore this with Landlab?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Landlab component *TaylorNonLinearDiffuser*, which implements the equations above, to explore how hillslopes evolve when nonlinear diffusion describes hillslope sediment transport. We will explore the steady state form of the landscape and sensitivity to parameters. Here steady state is defined as erosion rate equal to rock uplift rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example illustrates how to set-up the model and evolve a hillslope to steady state, along with how to plot some variables of interest. For more information on hillslope sediment transport laws, this paper is a great overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Roering, Joshua J. (2008) \"How well can hillslope evolution models “explain” topography? Simulating soil transport and production with high-resolution topographic data.\" Geological Society of America Bulletin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the first example, you are asked to first think about what will happen as you change a parameter, and then you explore this numerically by changing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (shift - enter OR got to the _Cell_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Run Cells_). \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can always go to the _Kernel_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Restart & Clear Output_ or _Restart & Run All_ if you change things and want to start afresh. If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated. (E.g. if you change parameters but don't reset the code blocks that initialize run time or topography, then these values will not be reset.) "

    "1. From your experience with the linear diffusion model, you now know that if diffusivity is fixed, then a hillslope becomes steeper if the uplift/erosion rate is increased or the diffusivity is decreased. Run a few model cases to illustrate the same behavior holds at steady state using the nonlinear diffusion model. Describe the model sensitivity to erosion rate and diffusivity using plots and text. Is the nonlinear model as sensitive to changes in these paramaters as the linear model? Make sure it is clear how you are making your assesment of what it means to be more or less sensitive.\n",
    "2. How does changing $S_c$ impact hillslope form at steady state? Do some model runs to illustrate hillslope sensitivity to $S_c$. Make sure you include plots and text to describe your findings.\n",
    "3. If relief is defined as the difference between maximum and minimum elevation, do hillslopes evolved with the linear or nonlinear model have more relief? Compare hillslopes with the same $D$ value between the two models. Use plots and text to support your answer. (This is a very unconstrained question. I'm just trying to get you thinking about the slopes and relief produced using the different models. You may find that some hillslope forms don't seem realistic. This is a model, and that is OK.)"
