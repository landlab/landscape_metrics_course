    "**What is this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the evolution of detachment-limited channels in an actively uplifting landscape. The landscape evolves according to the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\frac{d z}{d t} = U - K_\\text{sp} A^{m_{sp}} S^{n_{sp}} + \\nabla q_s\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the first term on the right hand side is rock uplift, the second term is fluvial incision, and the third term in erosion/deposition due to hillslope processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fluvial incision term, $K_{sp}$ is the erodibility coefficient, which is thought to be positively correlated with climate wetness, or storminess (this is hard to quantify) and to be negatively correlated with rock strength (again, rock strength is hard to quantify). $m_{sp}$ and $n_{sp}$ are positive exponents, usually thought to have a ratio, $m_{sp}/n_{sp} \\approx 0.5$. $A$ is drainage area and $S$ is the slope of steepest descent ($-\\frac{dz}{dx}$) where $x$ is horizontal distance (positive in the downslope direction) and $z$ is elevation. (If slope is negative there is no fluvial erosion.) The fluvial erosion term is also known as the stream power equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hillslope sediment transport equation here is described using linear diffusion :\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "q_s = -D \\nabla z\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where ${q}_s$ is the transport rate with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$;  $D$ is a transport coefficient (or diffusivity) with dimensions of L$^2$T$^{-1}$; and $z$ is elevation. $\\nabla z$ is the gradient in elevation. If distance is increasing downslope, $\\nabla z$ is negative downslope, hence the negative in front of $D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should know the term **drainage density** ($Den$) for this exercise.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Den = \\frac{\\sum l}{A}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $l$ is a length of channel, and $\\sum l$ is the length of all channels in the watershed of interest, and $A$ is the drainage area of the watershed of interest. In other words, more length of channels over the same area means a higher drainage density (that should make sense!). \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate drainage density (which we won't do here), one would need to know where the transition from hillslope to channel happens on a landscape. This is oddly hard. One tool that can be used to determine where channels begin is the slope-area plot. At the smallest drainage area are hillslopes. As drainage area increases on a hillslope (moving down the hillslope), the slope increases. This is seen as a positive trend in a slope-area plot. At some drainage area, the slope starts to decrease. At this **critical drainage area**, where the slope-area plot goes from an increasing, positive trend to a decreasing, negative trend, is where the landscape switches from hillslope to channel. The larger the critical drainage area, the longer the hillslopes, the smaller the drainage density.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What will you do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will modify the code to get a better understanding of what sets the relief in a watershed. You will be asked to change the diffusivity and fluvial erodibilty to create watersheds with different drainage densities and explore how relief changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at the top by reading each block of text and sequentially running each code block (shift - enter OR got to the _Cell_ pulldown menu at the top and choose _Run Cells_). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you just change one code block and rerun only that code block, only the parts of the code in that code block will be updated. (E.g. if you change parameters but don't reset the code blocks that initialize run time or topography, then these values will not be reset.) "

Code Blocks 8-12 produce different figures that you may find useful. You can use any or all of these different figures to help you with the questions below.

    "\n",
    "1. Using the parameters provided in the initial notebook, run the landscape to steady state. (Note that you can keep running the main evolution loop - Code Block 7 - and the different plotting blocks without running the code blocks above them.) [These landscapes may not reach a perfect steady state. Close is fine.] When the landscape reaches steady state, record the channel steepness, $k_{sn}$ (only applies for the channelized part of the landscape) and total relief (in this case the minimum elevation is zero, so the total relief is just the maximum elevation). Also note the approximate critical drainage area. (See the description at the top of this notebook if you don't know that term.) Save some illustrative plots. This example has a relatively small critical drainage area/large drainage density. (10 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rerun the notebook with a new diffusivity value, but keep all other parameters the same (so do not change the fluvial erodibility or rock uplift value). You should find a scenario with a critical drainage area higher than the initial value, but less than 1e6 m$^2$. Run to steady state, and record the critical drainage area, channel steepness index, and total relief. Make sure you also record the diffusivity value used. Save some illustrative plots. (10 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2. So same everything except use a third, different diffusivity value. This example should have a different critical drainage from the previous two landscapes, and the critical drainage area should be less than 1e6 m$^2$. (10 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now repeat steps 1, 2, and 3, two more times. I want you to choose two different fluvial erodibility values (both should be smaller than the original value of $K_{sp} = 1E-5$, i.e. they should produce larger $k_{sn}$ values). For each $K_{sp}$ value, you should produce three landscapes with three different diffusivity values. Try to keep all slope values (on hillslopes and channels) less than 1 m/m. Try to keep the critical drainage area less than 1e6 m$^2$. Record critical drainage area, channel steepness index, and total relief for all the landscapes. (20 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You should have produced a total of 9 steady-state landscapes, using three different fluvial erodibility values, and at least three different diffusivity values. In all cases, the uplift rate remained the same, so the erosion rate remained the same. What trends do you notice about controls on relief and channel steepness index? Is relief related to critical drainage area? Is it related to channel steepness index? Can you summarize (in 5 sentences or less) some things you have learned about rivers and fluvial erodbility, hillslopes and diffusivity, and topographic trends? (15 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Thought question ... If you had a larger watershed, do you think that would impact any of the trends (or lack of trends) that you observed? Please explain in 5 sentences or less. (5 pts)"
